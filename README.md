# exit-surveys
Project using the Python package "pandas" and various functions to combine, clean, and analyze data in multiple CSV files  

# Project Details:
For this project, we will take a look at employee exit surveys from two departments of the Queensland government in Australia:  
- Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)  
- Technical and Further Education (TAFE)  

Our main objective is to answer the following questions:
- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?  
- What about employees who have been there longer?
